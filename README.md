# trackrack
Asset tracking for lean hardware startups

## Why this app? 
Building hardware prototypes is tough. It's even tougher when you can't find *that one board* that exhibits *that particular issue*, or you can't figure out which boards are complete with Rework A versus Rework B. There's also the fundamental problem that circuit boards, despite having no apparent means of locomotion, always seem to walk off to someplace unexpected when you need to find them. 

## What You'll Need
	* You'll need a QR code reader app that can read 2D barcodes. Most contract manufacturers use these barcodes to track boards through internal manufacturing processes. Trackrack repurposes these so you can quickly and easily figure out who has your prototype hardware. 
	* A locally provisioned Linux box to serve the application. We've tested on Ubuntu 14.04. 

## How Does It Work? 

## Is this free?
Trackrack is free, as in speech, and free, as in beer, for anyone to use, download, modify, etc.
