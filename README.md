# trackrack - asset tracking for hardware startups

## Why this app? 
Building hardware prototypes is tough. It's even tougher when you can't find *that one board* that exhibits *that particular issue*, or you can't figure out which boards have been changed with Rework A versus Rework B. There's also the fundamental problem that circuit boards, despite having no apparent means of locomotion, always seem to disappear when you need to find them. 

Trackrack's goal is to give you a really simple way to handle this combination of asset tracking and rework bookkeeping by using existing smartphone technology along with QR codes commonly used by contract manufacturers.

## What You'll Need
* You'll need a QR code reader app that can read 2D barcodes. Most contract manufacturers use these barcodes to track boards through internal manufacturing processes. Trackrack repurposes these so you can quickly and easily figure out who has your prototype hardware. 
* A locally provisioned Linux box to serve the application. We've tested on Ubuntu 14.04. 

## Is this free?
Trackrack is free, as in speech, and free, as in beer, for anyone to use, download, modify, etc.
